## Why new site?

I used to blog using Ghost(an open-source blogging software) but it used database at its backend just like wordpress, and this makes the site slow, especially if there is lot of content. 

Using a database also makes my server prone to direct attacks. This is not good.

I was looking at static site generators for a long time and finally got around to set them up. They are extremely fast, lightweight and build in just few seconds. Building quick was important to me and that is why i chose hugo over jekyll and other static site generators. Hugo is extremely fast, creating content using markdown is just a breeze.

This site also has RSS feeds, just click on the RSS icon on homepage and get content updates on your favourite rss readers.

Who knows? This might finally get me into serious blogging.
